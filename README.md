## 📝 Description

## 📌 Gameplay Guidelines
The Checkers Game is a riveting test of strategy and foresight, played on an 8x8 gameboard. Here's a brief overview of the gameplay:

**Initiation**: At the game's onset, each player is bestowed with 12 pieces (checkers), each adorning the dark squares of the board's three nearest rows.

**Piece Movement**: Players alternate turns, tactically maneuvering their pieces diagonally across the board's dark squares. As pieces reach the opposing player's back row, they ascend to "king" status, granting them the liberty to move in both forward and backward directions.

**Capture Maneuvers**: A defining aspect of the game is the ability to capture opponent pieces. Should a player's piece stand adjacent to an opponent's, and an unoccupied square be found beyond it, the player may elect to "jump" over the adversary's piece, thus effectuating a capture. Multiple captures may be executed in a single turn if they form a contiguous diagonal line.

**The Reign of Kings**: Once a piece reaches "king" status, it inherits enhanced mobility, allowing it to traverse both forward and backward diagonals, thereby broadening its capture scope.

**Ultimate Objective**: The primary aim of the game is to vanquish all of the opponent's pieces or to stymie their ability to execute any legal moves.

**Termination Criteria**: The game culminates when one player successfully captures all of the opponent's pieces or when a player finds themselves bereft of any viable moves.
